### The Scrum To-do List
Want to deliver projects on time? Scrum To-Do Lists help you to do this. Understanding the fundamentals of scrum is a very simple thing to do. However putting it into practice in the world of deadlines, strong characters and the need for quick decisions can often make it a huge challenge to get the job done using the scrum rules. There are often situations where the rules are forgotten and put to one side, especially when they are most needed.

In my experience as a scrum master, team lead and software engineer I saw how easy it is for employees of a fast moving business to put the scrum rules to one side and destroy the very framework that would help make their daily lives easier. Observing how easy it is to forget the fundamental elements of scrum, I have put together this simple To-Do List that anyone can use on a daily basis. It covers:

To-Do List for the fundamental tasks of every scrum role
an overview and recap of each scrum meeting (time-box)
To-Do List for the preparation, carrying-out and goals of every scrum meeting
Using these To-Do List, you can be prepared and confident that you are carrying out the scrum practices on your daily job, boosting the productivity of your scrum team and increasing return on investment for the business. One section of the check list is below.

### The SCRUM MASTER To-Do List
o update list of impediments from daily scrum, emails and other contact

o follow up on impediments above

o order any team equipment

o write sprint report to stake holders (once a sprint)

o chase up any information holding up sprint backlog (eg. third party supplied artefacts)

o make sure burndown and task board are visible in team room

o arrange meetings and have chats to coach any new or needy team members, product owners or stakeholders

### The PRODUCT OWNER To-Do List
o update backlog daily with any changes

o prioritise backlog daily based on business value

o meet stakeholders when needed to coordinate and capture requirements

o liaise with team to clarify requirements and make trade offs communicate release plan to stakeholders

### The DEVELOPERS To-Do List
o update task board with time remaining on tasks

o report any impediments to scrum master

o communicate with product owner before attempting and after completing a story

o achieve daily targets

o maintain team communication

o keep solutions simple

o focus on ship-ability (e.g. using practices such as pair programming, code review, continuous refactoring)

## Section 2 : The world before agile and scrum 
Learning objectives
1. What is wrong with traditional methods of project managemnt
2. What is the waterfall model and why it's less flexable than agile
3. What is agile and how is it different from scrum
    Agile is not an alternative to Scrum but an umbrella term for a set of methodologies and frameworks that share a manifesto and a set of principles.
     Scrum is one such framework.


   Birth of agile:
   Image of waterfall vs iterative  method of the development process:

[XP, FDD, DSDM, and Crystal Methods of Agile Development](https://project-management.com/xp-fdd-dsdm-and-crystal-methods-of-agile-development/)
- XP
- Crystal
- DSDM
- FDD
  
The object mentor group agreed on set of principles and made [the manifesto for agile software developmemnt](https://agilemanifesto.org/)

   [Waterfall model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNLcRdrSQAU)
    -  SDLC: linear, sequential approach to the software development lifecycle
    ![whatis-waterfall_model](https://github.com/rominalodolo/ScrumMaster/assets/83961643/b77c78e2-786f-4480-8542-46bb09d1ad0f)
    - If the requirements change after the requirements phase, then this has a knock-on effect to the other phases, therefore, the launch date becomes more difficult to hit. On top of that, the bulk of the defects and issues are not usually found until the test phase. This often delays launch, since more time is needed to fix bugs. This situation usually leads to overtime, low morale, and a last minute scramble towards the end of the project.
   

## Section 3 : Introducing Scrum 
1. What is [Scrum](https://www.techagilist.com/agile/scrum-theory-scrum-framework/)
  Self Managing cross functional TEAMS
  Scrum theory
    * Iteratve
    * Incremental
    * Theories: Transparancy, Inspection, Adaptation
  ![scrum-pillars](https://github.com/rominalodolo/ScrumMaster/assets/83961643/9fe3764a-7ad1-4ec7-bb9a-95f86ead763b)

   **Scrum skeleton**

**Self-Managing over Self-Organizing**
Scrum teams are self-managing, choosing who does the work, how, and what to work on.

**Lean Thinking**
As well as Empiricism, Scrum is founded on Lean Thinking. Lean thinking reduces waste and focuses on the essentials. as you will see Scrum removes waste (impediments) and prioritises value (essentials).


3. What the core theory of scrum is
  Its a framework not a comeplete process 

4. An overview of the Scrum practices
   Deliving often. 
   Using evidence from the past to keep improving. 
   Inspection shouldn't be too frequent that it gets in the way of doing actual work.
