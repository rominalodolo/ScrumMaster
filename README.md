### The Scrum To-do List
Want to deliver projects on time? Scrum To-Do Lists help you to do this. Understanding the fundamentals of scrum is a very simple thing to do. However putting it into practice in the world of deadlines, strong characters and the need for quick decisions can often make it a huge challenge to get the job done using the scrum rules. There are often situations where the rules are forgotten and put to one side, especially when they are most needed.

In my experience as a scrum master, team lead and software engineer I saw how easy it is for employees of a fast moving business to put the scrum rules to one side and destroy the very framework that would help make their daily lives easier. Observing how easy it is to forget the fundamental elements of scrum, I have put together this simple To-Do List that anyone can use on a daily basis. It covers:

To-Do List for the fundamental tasks of every scrum role
an overview and recap of each scrum meeting (time-box)
To-Do List for the preparation, carrying-out and goals of every scrum meeting
Using these To-Do List, you can be prepared and confident that you are carrying out the scrum practices on your daily job, boosting the productivity of your scrum team and increasing return on investment for the business. One section of the check list is below.

### The SCRUM MASTER To-Do List
o update list of impediments from daily scrum, emails and other contact

o follow up on impediments above

o order any team equipment

o write sprint report to stake holders (once a sprint)

o chase up any information holding up sprint backlog (eg. third party supplied artefacts)

o make sure burndown and task board are visible in team room

o arrange meetings and have chats to coach any new or needy team members, product owners or stakeholders

### The PRODUCT OWNER To-Do List
o update backlog daily with any changes

o prioritise backlog daily based on business value

o meet stakeholders when needed to coordinate and capture requirements

o liaise with team to clarify requirements and make trade offs communicate release plan to stakeholders

### The DEVELOPERS To-Do List
o update task board with time remaining on tasks

o report any impediments to scrum master

o communicate with product owner before attempting and after completing a story

o achieve daily targets

o maintain team communication

o keep solutions simple

o focus on ship-ability (e.g. using practices such as pair programming, code review, continuous refactoring)

## Section 2 : The world before agile and scrum 
Learning objectives
1. What is wrong with traditional methods of project managemnt
2. What is the waterfall model and why it's less flexable than agile
3. What is agile and how is it different from scrum
    Agile is not an alternative to Scrum but an umbrella term for a set of methodologies and frameworks that share a manifesto and a set of principles.
     Scrum is one such framework.


   Birth of agile:
   Image of waterfall vs iterative  method of the development process:
![Waterfall_vs_iterative](https://github.com/rominalodolo/ScrumMaster/assets/83961643/3f66a798-c715-4442-8b28-3e60c1e21f8a)

[XP, FDD, DSDM, and Crystal Methods of Agile Development](https://project-management.com/xp-fdd-dsdm-and-crystal-methods-of-agile-development/)
- XP
- Crystal
- DSDM
- FDD
  
The object mentor group agreed on set of principles and made [the manifesto for agile software developmemnt](https://agilemanifesto.org/)

   [Waterfall model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNLcRdrSQAU)
    -  SDLC: linear, sequential approach to the software development lifecycle
    ![whatis-waterfall_model](https://github.com/rominalodolo/ScrumMaster/assets/83961643/b77c78e2-786f-4480-8542-46bb09d1ad0f)
    - If the requirements change after the requirements phase, then this has a knock-on effect to the other phases, therefore, the launch date becomes more difficult to hit. On top of that, the bulk of the defects and issues are not usually found until the test phase. This often delays launch, since more time is needed to fix bugs. This situation usually leads to overtime, low morale, and a last minute scramble towards the end of the project.
   

## Section 3 : Introducing Scrum 
1. What is [Scrum](https://www.techagilist.com/agile/scrum-theory-scrum-framework/)
  Self Managing cross functional TEAMS
  Scrum theory
    * Iteratve
    * Incremental
    * Theories: Transparancy, Inspection, Adaptation
  ![scrum-pillars](https://github.com/rominalodolo/ScrumMaster/assets/83961643/9fe3764a-7ad1-4ec7-bb9a-95f86ead763b)

   **Scrum skeleton**
![scrum_process](https://github.com/rominalodolo/ScrumMaster/assets/83961643/9ee8e0d1-ebcf-4edf-9f24-cf91f481d929)

**Self-Managing over Self-Organizing**
Scrum teams are self-managing, choosing who does the work, how, and what to work on.

**Lean Thinking**
As well as Empiricism, Scrum is founded on Lean Thinking. Lean thinking reduces waste and focuses on the essentials. as you will see Scrum removes waste (impediments) and prioritises value (essentials).


3. What the core theory of scrum is
  Its a framework not a comeplete process 

4. An overview of the Scrum practices
   * Deliving often. 
   * Using evidence from the past to keep improving. 
   * Inspection shouldn't be too frequent that it gets in the way of doing actual work.
  
     4 formal events for inspection and adaptation:
     1. Sprint planning
     2. Daily Scrum
     3. Sprint Review
     4. Sprint Retrospective

_Empiricism is about learning from the mistakes from the past_

[**Sprint**](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/sprints)
A sprint is an iteration of a calender month or less in which a product increment is delivered. 
Setting sprint length should give enough opportinity to inspect and adapt. 

  **How to plan and execute scrum sprints**

## Section 4 : Scrum team accountabitlities
Scrum Team 
1. Scrum master:
  * Understanding the scrum rules,
  * remove impepements and
  * help team slef manage
  * Go-to person
  * facilitates meetings
  * helps product owner to maximize ROI
  * aids team in porductivity

2. Product owner
  * creates product backlog and provides featutes needed
  * makes decisions for ROI
  * tradeoff to maximise product value
  * priooritise requiremnets based on business value

3. The developers
  * Self managing and collaborative
  * Multi-skilled for the project, experts in their field 


**Developers and Scrum Team Size**

> Development Team is now referred to as "developers"
>> The goal was to eliminate the concept of a separate team within a team that has led to “proxy” or "us and them” behavior between the PO and Dev Team. There is now just one Scrum Team focused on the same objective, with three different sets of accountabilities: PO, SM, and Developers.

> Scrum Team Size
>> The Scrum Team is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint, typically 10 or fewer people. In general, we have found that smaller teams communicate better and are more productive. If Scrum Teams become too large, they should consider reorganizing into multiple cohesive Scrum Teams, each focused on the same product.

Note: The size of the scrum team above is not prescribed. It is recommended.

**The Product Owner**
  * Product Owner is responsible for maximising value of product & Developers
  * What a Product Owner isn't responsible for
  * What a Product Owner is accountable for
  * Product Owner accountable for prouct backlog
  * remind how YOU add value
  * Prioritising
  * using info from the teams to help make decisions
_For the Product Owner to succeed the entire organisation must respect their decisions_

**The Development Team**
 * The developers consit of professionals who do the work of delivering a potenially releasable Increment of 'DONE' product at the end of each sprint
 * DONE increment is key
 * Scrum recognises no titles for the developers members other than developer, regardless of the work being performed by the other person; there are no exceptions to this rule.

## Section 5 : Scrum events

1. Scrum events
  Time box / Event
  Ending and managing meetings on time.
  Scrum masters role to organise and manage these meetings.

**Sprint planning meeting - 8 hours for 1 month sprint.**  
Team plan the work for the next sprint 
4 hours meeting for a 2 week sprint 
3 topics - why(sprint goal), what, how. 
![image](https://github.com/rominalodolo/ScrumMaster/assets/83961643/cb39efad-cd6e-4c3d-897a-07a90001e28e)
Daily scrum: 
  1. What did I do yestrday that helped us meet the sprint goal?
  2. What will I do today to help us meet the sprint goal?
  3. Do I see any impediment that prevents me or us from meeting the Sprint goal?

Sprint review help after the sprint by the scrum mater. Sprint retrospective is held after the sprint review and before the next sprint. Each team member is asked what worked and what cuold be done better. 

**Release Planning meeting**
Not officially a scrum event but often used in scrum. 
Product backlog items prioritised for release.
Team agrees on what is feasible for release.
An indicator not a commitment. 

The 5 Scrum events: The sprint, Sprint planning, Daily scrum, Sprint review, sprint retrospective. 
Max length of a daily scrum = 15min. There is no minimum time. 
All events are compulsory otherwise you are not doing a scrum.

_Prescribed events are used in Scrum to create regulatirt and to maximize the need for meetings not defined in scrum. All events are time-boxed events, such that every event has a maximum duration._
